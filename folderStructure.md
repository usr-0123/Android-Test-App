Let's break down each folder:

src/: This is the root folder for your project's source code.
assets/: This folder contains static assets such as images, fonts, and other resources used in your application.
images/: Place all your image assets here.
fonts/: Store custom font files here.
components/: This folder contains reusable UI components.
common/: Place generic components that can be used across multiple screens.
screens/: Specific components for each screen of your application.
navigation/: This folder contains code related to app navigation (using React Navigation or any other navigation library).
screens/: This folder holds all the screen components of your application.
services/: This folder is used for API services, data fetching, and other utility services.
utils/: This folder contains utility functions and helper modules used throughout your application.
Here's a more detailed explanation of each folder and its purpose:

Assets: Separating assets (like images and fonts) into their own folder keeps your project organized and makes it easy to locate resources.
Components: This folder structure allows you to organize components based on their reusability and context. common/ contains components used across multiple screens, while screens/ holds components specific to each screen.
Navigation: Placing navigation-related code in a separate folder makes it easier to manage navigation logic and keep it separate from other parts of your application.
Screens: This is where you'll define all your screen components. Each screen should ideally have its own file, making it easier to find and update specific screens.
Services: API services and other data-related logic can be centralized in the services/ folder. This promotes separation of concerns and keeps business logic isolated.
Utils: Utility functions, constants, and helper modules can be placed in the utils/ folder. This folder helps in maintaining a clean separation of concerns and promotes code reuse.
